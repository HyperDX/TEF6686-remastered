## Installation

### Windows: ðŸªŸ
1) Press **"WIN+R"** and open **devmgmt.msc**
2) Under the section **"COM & LPT"**, you will see your tuner - mark down the COM port, you will need it later
3) Edit the **flash.bat** file and edit the **"COM"** port to the number you see in devmgmt.msc
4) Hold the **BOOT button** on your TEF6686 ESP32 board while starting the tuner, that will put it into the bootloader mode
5) Open **flash.bat** and wait until the proccess finishes
6) Reboot the tuner - that's it!
