## List of changes in the latest version:
### v1.21
- Added signal in dBm when the user is connected to Wi-Fi
- Wi-Fi icon rework (now the Wi-Fi icon will show whether you're connected to a network / XDR-GTK separately)
- Battery status updates without reboot, if you're not using Wi-Fi
- Signal should jump way less when a neighbour frequency is too strong
- XDR-GTK graph is now way smoother (similar to XDR F1HD)
- A TP indicator has been added next to PTY info
- Battery voltage calculation has been recalibrated (bugs may still occur)
- A new battery check has been added, which checks if the user has a battery connected or not
- The RT is now scrolling
- 2 new themes (Whiteout & Heaven)
- Fixed various graphical glitches

## Installation

### Windows: ðŸªŸ
1) Press **"WIN+R"** and open **devmgmt.msc**
2) Under the section **"COM & LPT"**, you will see your tuner - mark down the COM port, you will need it later
3) Edit the **flash.bat** file and edit the **"COM"** port to the number you see in devmgmt.msc
4) Hold the **BOOT button** on your TEF6686 ESP32 board while starting the tuner, that will put it into the bootloader mode
5) Open **flash.bat** and wait until the proccess finishes
6) Reboot the tuner - that's it!
